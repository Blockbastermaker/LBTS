we employed a novel computational pipeline for assisting protein target discovery. 
The pipeline allows de novo identification of protein targets for herbal ingredients 
by simulating ligand-protein interactions against the user-designated protein-ligand collection, 
in an efficient and high throughput manner. 
We evaluated the pipeline using three Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) ingredients 
such as acteoside, quercetin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) respectively. 
Majority of the known targets of these ingredients were successfully identified by 
the pipeline. Structural comparative analyses confirmed many predicted ligand-target 
interactions use same binding pockets and the same binding modes as those of known 
ligand-target interactions. Furthermore, we illustrated the mechanism of actions 
(MOAs) of the TCM ingredients by network analysis based on the predicted target profiles. 
Through the paper, we insist that the novel computational pipeline provides an 
alternate option to explore the MOA of herb medicine within a reasonable computational time. 
It is also particularly valuable in aiding precise drug discovery and drug repurposing 
via an economical and efficient route.
